# DBT-T-Cell

Project background

A challenge in high-throughput data generation is interpreting the enormous amounts of data. Various methods end up with a list of genes, each of which complex data is available. While for each project we are able to come up with visualization of these genes, the link to existing information is poor.


In this project we aim to solve this by providing direct links from research papers, Wikipedia, and special databases, to bespoke visualization systems. A proposed solution is the creation of a new web browser plugins to orchestrate the process. However many small details need be sorted out for this new infrastructure; How do you text mine gene and and pathway names from websites? How do you resolve ambiguities? How and which visualization system can you use? Re-use or write new? Would Wikipedia benefit from a new extension?

 

Project goals

1)        Study previous methods for visualization

2)        Enumerate databases and other resources to integrate

3)    a)        Implement linking system
      b)        Implement basic visualization of provided datasets

4)        Evaluate system on users

5)        Package and disseminate
